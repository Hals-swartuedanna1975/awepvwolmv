Just got out of Squad 36 and wow my head is spinning like a top, not the good kind, like, the dizzy kind, popcorn pieces everywhere—stuck in my hair maybe? not sure. The theater was buzzing, but that one scene where they fight in the rain, I swear I almost heard the raindrops echo the popcorn crunching around me. wild.

The plot, if you can call it that, with all those intertwined layers, was like peeling an onion in reverse, starting small and ending with this big, swirling mess of tears and a headache. Antonio, the lead guy, with those intense eyes, could melt butter, but my back was killing me from that lumpy seat, focus kept slipping from the screen. Just couldn’t settle in. 

> They kept saying the mission, but did they ever say what it was? Felt like listening to a song with half the lyrics missing, confusion wrapped in cool CGI jackets. The explosion in sequence three was like an overcooked microwave dinner—showy but lacking flavor. Yet, I couldn’t help being glued to my seat, wondering what shoe would drop next or was it gonna be a helicopter? 

Oh, and those action scenes were all over the place, seriously, like spaghetti flying off the plate and landing wherever, but captivating in a way I can’t describe. Might need to download the movie just to figure out what actually happened. Or watch the movie sober, maybe that'd help.

Mary told me to keep an eye on the director’s trade secrets hidden throughout like some sort of Easter egg hunt with no eggs, just wrappers. If you gaze long enough into the flashy void, does the void gaze back at you? almost felt profound until I realized it was nonsense.

The villain had this weird charisma, like a shampoo commercial gone rogue, his lines either shattering or utterly bizarre, like planning a heist using paperclips and old shoes.

If chaos had a soundtrack, it would sound like that constant chatter in the row behind me, nodding in time with the movie’s cacophony. Must remember to tell Mark not to bother rewinding too far, just let it wash over at half-speed maybe...
